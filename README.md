Boxle-Game - A small java minecraft clone
==========

Boxle is a small minecraft clone written in Java using LWJGL.  It is being developed both as an education project and as a possible more-open alternative to minecraft.
Most development is coordinated through IRC (#boxle on EsperNet).  If you do not have access to IRC, the issues section of github should have issues for most major projects.  Boxle is open to contributions, if you want to help either hop on IRC or make/comment on an issue.  When you are ready to submit code, send a pull request.

Boxle has minimal dependencies, just [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/) and [CompCore](https://github.com/warriordog/CompCore).
