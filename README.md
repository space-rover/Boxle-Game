Boxle-Game - A small java minecraft clone
==========

Boxle is a small minecraft clone written in Java using LWJGL.  It is being developed both as an education project and as a possible more-open alternative to minecraft.
Most development is coordinated through IRC.  The channel is #boxle on EsperNet.  If you do not have access to IRC, the issues section of github should have issues for most major projects.

Boxle has minimal dependencies, just [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/) and [CompCore](https://github.com/warriordog/CompCore).
